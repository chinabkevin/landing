                <strong>Important:</strong> Advoqat is a technology platform that facilitates connections 
                between users and legal professionals. While we provide AI-powered tools and connect you 
                with licensed attorneys, we are not a law firm. The AI assistant provides general 
                information only and should not be considered legal advice. Always consult with a 
                qualified attorney for specific legal matters.
              </p>

              <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
                An attorney-client relationship is formed only when you engage with a specific attorney 
                through our platform and both parties agree to the representation. The AI assistant and 
                general platform features do not create an attorney-client relationship.
